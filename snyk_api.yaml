    The Snyk API is available to customers on [paid
    plans](https://snyk.io/plans) and allows you to programatically integrate
    with Snyk.


    ## API vs CLI vs Snyk integration


    The API detailed below has the ability to test a package for issues, as they are defined by Snyk. It is important to note that for many package managers, using this API will be less accurate than running the [Snyk CLI](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk) as part of your build pipe, or just using it locally on your package. The reason for this is that more than one package version fit the requirements given in manifest files. Running the CLI locally tests the actual deployed code, and has an accurate snapshot of the dependency versions in use, while the API can only infer it, with inferior accuracy. It should be noted that the Snyk CLI has the ability to output machine-readable JSON output (with the `--json` flag to `snyk test`).


    A third option, is to allow Snyk access to your development flow via the existing [Snyk integrations](https://snyk.io/docs/). The advantage to this approach is having Snyk monitor every new pull request, and suggest fixes by opening new pull requests. This can be achieved either by integrating Snyk directly to your source code management (SCM) tool, or via a broker to allow greater security and auditability.


    If those are not viable options, this API is your best choice.


    ## API url


    The base URL for all API endpoints is https://snyk.io/api/v1/


    ## Authorization


    To use this API, you must get your token from Snyk. It can be seen on https://snyk.io/account/ after you register with Snyk and login.


    The token should be supplied in an `Authorization` header with the token, preceded by `token`:


    ```http

    Authorization: token API_KEY

    ```


    Otherwise, a 401 "Unauthorized" response will be returned.


    ```http

    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized

            {
                "code": 401,
                "error": "Not authorised",
                "message": "Not authorised"
            }
    ```


    ## Overview and entities


    The API is a REST API. It has the following entities:


    ### Test result


    The test result is the object returned from the API giving the results of testing a package for issues. It has the following fields:

Provided in markdown format. | "## Overview\n[`org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22log4j-core%22)\nIn Apache Log4j 2.x before 2.8.2, when using the TCP socket server or UDP socket server to receive serialized log events from another application, a specially crafted binary payload can be sent that, when deserialized, can execute arbitrary code.\n\n# Details\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution. \n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n- Apache Blog\n\n\n## References\n- [NVD](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-5645)\n- [jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1863)\n" |

    #### Patch


    A patch is an object like this one:


    ```json

    {
      "urls": [
        "https://snyk-patches.s3.amazonaws.com/npm/backbone/20110701/backbone_20110701_0_0_0cdc525961d3fa98e810ffae6bcc8e3838e36d93.patch"
      ],
      "version": "<0.5.0 >=0.3.3",
      "modificationTime": "2015-11-06T02:09:36.180Z",
      "comments": [
        "https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/commit/0cdc525961d3fa98e810ffae6bcc8e3838e36d93.patch"
      ],
      "id": "patch:npm:backbone:20110701:0"
    }

    ```


    ### From and upgrade paths


    Both from and upgrade paths are arrays, where each item within the array is a package `name@version`.


    Take the following `from` path:


    ```

    [
      "my-project@1.0.0",
      "actionpack@4.2.5",
      "rack@1.6.4"
    ]

    ```


    Assuming this was returned as a result of a test, then we know:


    - The package that was tested was `my-project@1.0.0`


    - The dependency with an issue was included in the tested package via the direct dependency `actionpack@4.2.5`


    - The dependency with an issue was [rack@1.6.4](https://snyk.io/vuln/rubygems:rack@1.6.4)


    Take the following `upgrade` path:


    ```

    [
      false,
      "actionpack@5.0.0",
      "rack@2.0.1"
    ]

    ```


    Assuming this was returned as a result of a test, then we know:


    - The package that was tested is not upgradable (`false`)


    - The direct dependency `actionpack` should be upgraded to at least version `5.0.0` in order to fix the issue


    - Upgrading `actionpack` to version `5.0.0` will cause `rack` to be installed at version `2.0.1`


    If the `upgrade` path comes back as an empty array (`[]`) then this means that there is no upgrade path available which would fix the issue.


    ### License issue


    A license issue has no additional fields other than the ones in "Issue".


    ### Snyk organization


    The organization in Snyk this request is applicable to. The organization determines the access rights, licenses policy and is the unit of billing for private projects.


    A Snyk organization has these fields:


    Property    | Type   | Description                   | Example                                |

    -----------:| ------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |

    name        | string | The organization display name | "deelmaker"                            |

    id          | string | The ID of the organization    | "3ab0f8d3-b17d-4953-ab6d-e1cbfe1df385" |


    ## Errors


    This is a beta release of this API. Therefore, despite our efforts, errors might occur. In the unlikely event of such an error, it will have the following structure as JSON in the body:


    Property    | Type   | Description                   | Example                                |

    -----------:| ------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |

    message     | string | Error message with reference  | Error calling Snyk api (reference: 39db46b1-ad57-47e6-a87d-e34f6968030b) |

    errorRef    | V4 uuid | An error ref to contact Snyk with | 39db46b1-ad57-47e6-a87d-e34f6968030b |


    The error reference will also be supplied in the `x-error-reference` header in the server reply.


    Example response:


    ```http

    HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error

    x-error-reference: a45ec9c1-065b-4f7b-baf8-dbd1552ffc9f

    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    Content-Length: 1848

    Vary: Accept-Encoding

    Date: Sun, 10 Sep 2017 06:48:40 GMT

    ```


    ## Rate Limiting


    To ensure resilience against increasing request rates, we are starting to introduce rate-limiting.

    We are monitoring the rate-limiting system to ensure minimal impact on users while ensuring system stability.

    Current limit is up to 2000 requests per minute, per user. This limit is above industry standards, and is subject to change. As such, we recommend calls to the API are throttled regardless of the current limit.

    All requests above the limit will get a response with status code `429` - `Too many requests` until requests stop for the duration of the rate-limiting interval (currently a minute).


    ## Consuming Webhooks


    Webhooks are delivered with a `Content-Type` of `application/json`, with the event payload as JSON in the request body. We also send the following headers:


    - `X-Snyk-Event` - the name of the event


    - `X-Snyk-Transport-ID` - a GUID to identify this delivery


    - `X-Snyk-Timestamp` - an ISO 8601 timestamp for when the event occurred, for example: `2020-09-25T15:27:53Z`


    - `X-Hub-Signature` - the HMAC hex digest of the request body, used to secure your webhooks and ensure the request did indeed come from Snyk


    - `User-Agent` - identifies the origin of the request, for example: `Snyk-Webhooks/XXX`


    ---


    After your server is configured to receive payloads, it listens for any payload sent to the endpoint you configured. For security reasons, you should limit requests to those coming from Snyk.


    ### Validating payloads


    All transports sent to your webhooks have a `X-Hub-Signature` header, which contains the hash signature for the transport. The signature is a HMAC hexdigest of the request body, generated using sha256 and your `secret` as the HMAC key.


    You could use a function in Node.JS such as the following to validate these signatures on incoming requests from Snyk:


    ```javascript

    import * as crypto from 'crypto';


    function verifySignature(request, secret) {
      const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
      const buffer = JSON.stringify(request.body);
      hmac.update(buffer, 'utf8');

      const signature = `sha256=${hmac.digest('hex')}`;

      return signature === request.headers['x-hub-signature'];
    }

    ```


    ### Payload versioning


    Payloads may evolve over time, and so are versioned. Payload versions are supplied as a suffix to the `X-Snyk-Event` header. For example, `project_snapshot/v0` indicates that the payload is `v0` of the `project_snapshot` event.


    Version numbers only increment when a breaking change is made; for example, removing a field that used to exist, or changing the name of a field. Version numbers do not increment when making an additive change, such as adding a new field that never existed before.


    **Note:** During the BETA phase, the structure of webhook payloads may change at any time, so we  recommend you check the payload version.


    ### Event types


    While consuming a webhook event, `X-Snyk-Event` header must be checked, as an end-point may receive multiple event types.


    #### ping


    The ping event happens after a new webhook is created, and can also be manually triggered using the ping webhook API. This is useful to test that your webhook receives data from Snyk correctly.


    The `ping` event makes the following request:


    ```jsx

    POST /webhook-handler/snyk123 HTTP/1.1

    Host: my.app.com

    X-Snyk-Event: ping/v0

    X-Snyk-Transport-ID: 998fe884-18a0-45db-8ae0-e379eea3bc0a

    X-Snyk-Timestamp: 2020-09-25T15:27:53Z

    X-Hub-Signature: sha256=7d38cdd689735b008b3c702edd92eea23791c5f6

    User-Agent: Snyk-Webhooks/044aadd

    Content-Type: application/json

    { 
      "webhookId": "d3cf26b3-2d77-497b-bce2-23b33cc15362"
    }

    ```


    #### project_snapshot


    This event is triggered every time an existing project is tested and a new snapshot is created. It is triggered on every test of a project, whether or not there are new issues. This event is not triggered when a new project is created or imported.


    ```jsx

    POST /webhook-handler/snyk123 HTTP/1.1

    Host: my.app.com

    X-Snyk-Event: project_snapshot/v0

    X-Snyk-Transport-ID: 998fe884-18a0-45db-8ae0-e379eea3bc0a

    X-Snyk-Timestamp: 2020-09-25T15:27:53Z

    X-Hub-Signature: sha256=7d38cdd689735b008b3c702edd92eea23791c5f6

    User-Agent: Snyk-Webhooks/044aadd

    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "project": { ... }, // project object matching API responses
      "org": { ... }, // org object matching API responses
      "group": { ... }, // group object matching API responses
      "newIssues": [], // array of issues object matching API responses
      "removedIssues": [], // array of issues object matching API responses
    }

    ```

        additional metadata to a project.

        Attributes have a pre-defined list of values that a user can select from.

        It is possible to assign multiple values to each attribute, but you can only assign values to one of the predefined attribute categories, using the predefined options for this category.

        Assigning an attribute requires the caller to be either an Org Administrator or a Group Administrator.

        Assigning an attribute will override any existing values that the specific attribute already has set.

        In order to clear out an attribute value, an empty array can be set.

        The organization determines the access rights, licenses policy and is the unit of billing for private projects.


        An organization should be given as a query parameter named `org`, with the public identifier given to this org. The list of organizations and their corresponding public ids can be found with the org resource.
