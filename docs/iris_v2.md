## Overview  
The IRIS v2 app allows users to interact with IRIS API endpoints. Authentication is required to access these endpoints, and it is done via an API key.  

## Authentication  

To authenticate with IRIS v2, follow these steps:  

1. **Navigate to Authentication Settings**  
   - Go to the IRIS v2 app authentication page in Shuffle.  

2. **Enter Required Fields**  
   - **Label for Identification**: Provide a label to recognize this authentication instance.  
   - **API Key**: Enter your IRIS API key, which can be found in your IRIS account under **My Settings > API Key**.  
   - **URL**: Provide the base URL for your IRIS instance, typically in the format:  
     ```
     https://<your_ip>
     ```  

3. **Submit the Credentials**  
   - Click the **Submit** button to save your authentication details.  

## Notes  
- The API key is required for authorization and should be kept confidential.  
- Ensure that the URL is correct and accessible from your network.  
- If authentication fails, verify that your API key and URL are correct and active.
