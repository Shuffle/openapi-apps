# Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is a database and search engine used in a multitude of ways. In Shuffle, we typically think of it as a part of ELK.

## Authentication
Authentication with your ELK instance is 100% defined by how you set up your Elasticsearch instance. It's based on the security configuration YOU have decided.

[Elasticsearch security documentation](https://docs.bmc.com/docs/vulnerabilitymanagement/31/configuring-authentication-for-elasticsearch-862833993.html#:~:text=The%20default%20Elasticsearch%20installation%20contains,server%20and%20in%20the%20input_files.)

If you don't have or know the username or password, leave them blank or add a space.

PS: Default username is admin and default password is elasticadmin
